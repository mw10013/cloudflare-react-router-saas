   * You should always try and make your SQL statements to be safe to run multiple times.
   * Even though `SQLSchemaMigrations.runAll()` keeps track of the last migration ID and

   * in the `SQLSchemaMigrationsConfig.migrations` list altering the schema as you wish.
   *
   * In majority of cases you should always provide this. In the cases where you need to dynamically
   * fetch your statements at runtime, the `SQLSchemaMigrations.runAll` function accepts
   * a function (`genSql`) that will be called when migrations are executed and based on the `idMonotonicInc`
   * you can return the SQL statement to run at that point.
   * If `sql` is provided, then that callback function is not called even if provided.

 * write into the SQLite database, or at least run it once in the constructor of your DO.
